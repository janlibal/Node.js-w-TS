Node.js - Typescript Playground

Questions:


1)

In index.ts using import statements.

In package.json: "type": "commonjs" (not working with "module")
in tsconfig.json: "module": "CommonJS" (not working with "module")

As far as I've experienced, import statements should go with "module"


2)

VS Studio is complaining that there's an error in tsconfig.json. The error goes as follows: "No inputs were found in config file 'c:/devSTRV/02/typescript/tsconfig.json'. Specified 'include' paths were '["**/*"]' and 'exclude' paths were '["./dist"]'.
The code works fine though.
